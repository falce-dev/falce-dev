# About me

A software developer born and raised directly in the field, I started my career at a top-tier healthcare company in Italy, where I was immediately exposed to real-world problems and operational IT needs.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a solid and versatile technical background by working across multiple technology stacks.  
My approach is rooted in **real-world problem-solving**, **concrete process automation**, and the ability to deliver solutions that make an immediate and measurable impact inside organizations.
